# WiCyS EOH demo

## Play the game

While our final version ideally will have graphics and sound, for now we just have a text-based version of our master plans. Download this repository as a zip file, which includes a tutorial for Caesar ciphers (the PDF titled "wicys_sp21_caesar_ciphers.pdf") which you might find handy as well as the game code.

Once you have downloaded this game, open up a terminal and navigate to this repository's directory. Then, to run this game:
```
python game.py
```

**Warning: this code was hastily written in Python 3, so if you are using Python 2 to run this, you will have to add quotation marks around all of your inputs for this to work as intended. Check your python version by typing ```python --version```**

If something goes wrong, try using ```python3``` instead and/or downloading python 3 .

Try not to look at the code before playing the game since we weren't particularly clever with obfuscating the puzzle answer (it's more like we didn't try at all), but if you're stuck, then... maybe you do want to take a peek. We did not go for quality in our implementation, as you will see. If that bothers you, then come join us to fix our code ;)
