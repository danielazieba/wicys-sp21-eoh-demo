You saunter on into your kitchen, which is surprisingly large given that you're in a college student apartment. Adorned with classic-diner-black-and-white-checkered tiling, the cabinets and walls are varying shades of pinks, purples, and blue. It kind of works together.

Options you have while in the kitchen:
A: brew coffee
B: make toast
C: open cabinet
D: open fridge
E: move to the living room
H: get a hint for what to do next

(To select an option, type the corresponding letter and press enter. For example, to get a hint for what to do next, type "H" and press enter.)
