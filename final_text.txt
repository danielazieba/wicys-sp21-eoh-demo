You have managed to unlock your computer, which will aid you in your journey of eating breakfast! We have a few more puzzles planned for you after this point, but this is where your text-based demo ends.

Thank you for playing, and if you're interested in helping us finish up the game, we would love to hear from you! No experience in puzzle-making or CTFs or games or security is required, as long as you're able to show up every week and help us finish things up.
